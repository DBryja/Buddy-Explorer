## My Process

### Step By Step

This was my first own project using Express and I'm glad that I have managed to complete it.
I first started of writing down ideas, and features that I would like to implement in my project.
Then I began to code all the features - registration, connecting to database, autocompletion etc. with rough ejs templates with little to no styling.
After that I have designed all pages in Figma both for mobile and desktop, skipping tablet size.
Then I began rewriting ejs templates and styling those.

### Continued Development

My project have a lot of space to improve and add new features which I skipped because I wanted to move on from this project.
Here is a list of things that I would implement if only I had infinite time :^) :
- First of all, prevent SQL injections using some library, for some reason I didn't think of it while developing o_O
- More user data/search filters: known languages, prefferable price, guide rating + comments, age, gender etc.
- Admin panel to make it easier to manage users.
- Built-in communicator to replace currently used email.

Things that I would improve :

- Add client-side validators,
- Replace current cities/counties database with a proffesional one or with polish government API (https://api.stat.gov.pl/Home/TerytApi),
- Rework autocomplete to be based on data-key attributes so the autocomplete elements can be more independent as they now require strict construction:
  ```html
  <div id="cities_Searchbars">
    -> big container
    <p class="error sb_start"></p>
    -> first element, it can be an empty span, but it must exist
    <div class="autocomplete_box">
      -> input container. Holding input field, delete button and suggestions container
      <div>
        <input type="text" class="city_autocomplete city" placeholder="city" name="city" autocomplete="off" />
        <button class="item_delete prevent">Usu≈Ñ</button> -> free of choice element, may be a div, button or anything
        else
      </div>
      <div class="cities_container"></div>
      -> container storing suggested items
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
  ```js
  function autocompleteSearch(type, searchBox, query = "") {
    fetch(`/get_${type}?${type}=${query}`)
      .then(function (response) {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then(function (responseData) {
        if (responseData.length > 0) {
          let arr = [];
          responseData.forEach((item) => {
            arr.push(item);
          });
          arr = [...new Set(arr)];
          searchBox.textContent = "";
          arr.forEach((item) => {
            const row = document.createElement("p");
            row.classList.add("autocomplete_item");
            row.textContent = item;
            searchBox.appendChild(row);
            row.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
              const acBox = e.target.parentElement.previousElementSibling.previousElementSibling;
              acBox.value = e.target.textContent;
              searchBox.textContent = "";
              searchBox.classList.remove("active");
            });
          });
        }
      });
  }
  ```
